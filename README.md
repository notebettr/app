# Hello!

This app is in the very very beginning stages of development. It will eventually be a note taking app that is designed to support folks with ADHD take better notes and improve their retention and comprehension of the content that they took notes on. This app will be suitable for both students and working professionals. 

I will be taking volunteers for beta testing of the MVP in the near future! If you are interesting in being a beta tester, please email anna@desertform.com. Thank you!
